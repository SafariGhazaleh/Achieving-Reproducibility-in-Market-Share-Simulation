# Achieving-Reproducibility-in-Market-Share-Simulation

## Problem
In this assignment, we aim to address the non-reproducibility issue associated with the market share of the second-most widely used technology in individual runs of a technology choice model. The challenge arises from the inherent stochasticity of the model, where early random effects significantly impact the simulation's trajectory, resulting in path-dependent outcomes. To achieve reproducibility, we propose modifying the existing script to incorporate a random seed parameter and setting this seed to a fixed value. By doing so, we aim to ensure consistency in the random processes, allowing for the replication of the simulation with identical outcomes. The approach involves executing the modified script, specifying the desired random seed, running simulations for a predefined number of time periods, and recording the market share of the second-most widely used technology after 5000 time periods. Users can confirm reproducibility by executing the script multiple times with the same seed, expecting consistent results.

# Solution
The output value of interest, which is the market share of the second-most widely used technology, is not reproducible in individual runs due to the presence of random elements in the simulation. The agents in the model make choices based on the technologies used by their direct neighbors, and the specific choices made by each agent are influenced by a probabilistic function. This introduces randomness into the simulation, as the choice of technology for each agent can vary based on the random distribution of technologies in the neighborhood. As a result, even with the same initial conditions and parameters, the sequence of random events and choices made by individual agents can differ, leading to variations in the final market share of the second-most widely used technology.

Reproducibility can be achieved for this output variable by ensuring that the random elements in the simulation are controlled using a fixed seed value. By setting a specific seed value before running the simulation, the random number generator will produce the same sequence of random numbers in each run. This ensures that the same set of random events and choices are generated, leading to consistent results. In the provided script, the seed value is set to 0, which guarantees reproducibility of the market share of the second-most widely used technology.

“Market share of the second-most widely used technology: 0. 137”
Using the script provided with the seed value of 0, the market share of the second-most widely used technology is consistently reproducible with a value of 0. 137. This means that in each run of the simulation, the market share of the second-most widely used technology will be approximately 0. 137.
